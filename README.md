### üìô Using a Sitemap Generator
To create a sitemap for your website, you need to store the sitemap indexes in the data/sitemaps/sitemap-indexes.json file. This is where you can define the sitemap indexes for different types of pages on your website.

Once you've defined the sitemap indexes, you can format them in any way you like. Here's an example of how you can format your sitemap:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "domain": "https://rickarendsen.nl"
    },

    "pages": [
        {
            "location": "/",
            "last_modification": "2023-03-28",
            "change_frequency": "daily",
            "priority": 0.8
        }
    ]
}
```
To use this code, simply copy and paste it into your own sitemap file. You can customize the values to fit your website's specific needs.

### ‚öôÔ∏èGenerating the sitemaps
To generate sitemaps for your website, you can use the index.js file which is included in your website's codebase. To run this file and initiate the sitemap generation process, you can use the following command in your command-line interface:

```sh
node index.js
```

This command will start the sitemap generation process and create the necessary sitemap files based on the configuration you have defined in the data/sitemaps/sitemap-indexes.json file.
